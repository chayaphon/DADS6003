## Objective
The main objective of this project is to predict stock prices hourly based on various features using logistic regression.
If next hoour closing price is higher than current closing price, then we will buy the stock (1), else we will sell it (-1). 
If the output is 0.7, then we can say that there is a 70% chance that next closing price is higher than current closing price and classify it as 1.

In this Assignment will compare with 2 scenario where first scenario will use standard feature as (Open, High, Low,	Close) price.
And for the second scenario will use addional feature (Open, High, Low, Close, S_10, Corr, RSI, Open-Close, Open-Open)

As the model output on strategic return, the secornd scenario gives the better return.
